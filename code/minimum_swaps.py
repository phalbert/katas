Question:
Mary can perform the following minimal sequence of swap operations to 
successfully sort all 3 items by decreasing popularity rating: [3, 1, 2] â†’ [3, 2, 1].

rearrange the items on the shelf by  decreasing popularity rating such that the rating for the i item
is always greater than the popularity rating of the (i + 1) item.

Solution:
1. The swap always compares the last element in the array with
 the least element in the remaining list e.g.  
 in the case  of [3, 1, 2, 4]...we compare 4 with the minimum value in [3,1,2]
  and swap the two if the minimum value is less
2. Repeat 1 until the the list is sorted in descending order
3. Do the above while counting the swaps"""
